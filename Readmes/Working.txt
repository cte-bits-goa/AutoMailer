################################ Working of the Automailer ################################
								
								How does the automailer work ?

.. As mentioned in the pre-requisites The automailer needs :							
	
	1. The inputfile.csv and Credentials in the root folder
		The inputfile.csv must contain -
		A ) The name of the recipent
		B ) Recipent Email Address
		C ) Name of the certificate with extension (any)
		all corresponding in a single row
		Credentials to be provided in credentials.txt (makes it fault-free)
	
	2. Certs Folder with all certificates named as per Cert row in CSV
	
	3. Text_files (later)


.. Next, The code is divided into three parts : Validation,Update,Mail and Progress
	
	1.Validation :
		Even after automation (if by chance someone deletes or incompletely downloads)
		checks if all text files, Certs folder are present or not, also automatically
		keeps a reserve copy of the initial csv in Copies folder.

		The user will be given the details, the LIMIT specified, the username, the course
		name so that if something is wrong it can be changed manually, it will print press
		0 to confirm - >
	
	2. Update :
		Sends a specified portion of the csv to mailer, the no. of which is defined
		in the csv updater code (currently 45) so it isnt messed with, also after the
		portion is sent down the pipeline the csv automatically gets trimmed of those
		entries also a copy of the csv right before removing those entries will be put
		in the copies folder (to keep the exact track if an error occurs in the very batch.

		After the csv is completed it is deleted and a new folder named complete is created
		If someone by mistake uses the script after the csv is finished it will show mailing list completed. - >
	
	3. Mailer :
		The most important part, it works on yagmail (pypi installable, works on SMTP)
		sends mail and prints Sent Mail to {NAME} so that one can keep track on gmail in the sent box

							
							How is flexibility increased ?
	
	1. To make use of it apart from cert mailing, just ask anyone to write the mail template
	with {NAME} and {SUBJECT}

	2. To remove certificates now there's no hassle simply remove
	,path.format(cert) from line 15 in mailer.py (in the codes folder)

	3.All three parts of codes are maintained independently and no use of master code allows
	to change the code without interference.

	4.To change the number of mails sent per day (presently 45 ie 90% of allowance [50])
	change LIMIT in line 9 of csv_updater.py
